### Basic React Problems

1.  **Create a Counter Component:**

    - Build a counter component that increases, decreases, and resets the count based on user interaction.

2.  **Todo List:**

    - Implement a simple todo list application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

3.  **Conditional Rendering:**

    - Create a component that displays different UI elements based on certain conditions or states (e.g., show a login button if the user is not logged in, and a logout button if they are).

### Intermediate React Problems

4.  **Component Lifecycle:**

    - Create a component that logs messages to the console at different stages of its lifecycle (e.g., when it mounts, updates, and unmounts).

5.  **Fetching Data from an API:**

    - Build a component that fetches data from an API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder or any public API) and displays it in a list or table.

6.  **Custom Hook:**

    - Write a custom hook that fetches data from an API and manages loading, error, and data states. Use this hook in a component to display the fetched data.

### Advanced React Problems

7. **Higher-Order Components (HOC):**

   - Create an HOC that adds additional data or functionality to a wrapped component (e.g., logging component usage analytics).

8. **Render Props:**

   - Implement a component that uses the render props pattern to share code between components in a flexible way.

9. **Optimizing Performance:**

   - Demonstrate the use of `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to optimize a component that has performance issues due to unnecessary re-renders.

10. **React Router:**

    - Set up a simple SPA (Single Page Application) with React Router, including routes for a home page, about page, and a dynamic route for user profiles.

11. **State Management (Beyond useState/useReducer):**

    - Illustrate a simple example of global state management using the Context API or any state management library like Redux or Recoil, showing how to share state across multiple components.

### Bonus Problems

12. **Accessibility (a11y):**

    - Enhance a React application by implementing various accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, and semantic HTML.

13. **Testing in React:**

    - use `create react app` to create a project with test setup...
    - Write unit tests for a React component using Jest and React Testing Library, covering user interactions and component logic.

14. **Static Site Generation with Next.js:**

    - Create a statically generated blog using Next.js, where each post is a markdown file that gets rendered to a webpage at build time.

15. **Server-Side Rendering with Next.js:**

    - Implement a simple application with server-side rendering to improve load times and SEO for dynamic content.
