### Basic React Problems

1.  **Create a Counter Component:**

    - Build a counter component that increases, decreases, and resets the count based on user interaction.

2.  **Todo List:**

    - Implement a simple todo list application where users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

3.  **Conditional Rendering:**

    - Create a component that displays different UI elements based on certain conditions or states (e.g., show a login button if the user is not logged in, and a logout button if they are).

4.  **List Rendering:**

    - Given an array of items, render a list of these items using React and ensure it has a key prop for each item to improve performance.

5.  **Form Handling:**

    - Create a form with inputs for submitting a user's first name, last name, and email. Upon submission, display the inputted information below the form.

### Intermediate React Problems

6.  **Component Lifecycle:**

    - Create a component that logs messages to the console at different stages of its lifecycle (e.g., when it mounts, updates, and unmounts).

7.  **Fetching Data from an API:**

    - Build a component that fetches data from an API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder or any public API) and displays it in a list or table.

8.  **UseContext Hook:**

    - Implement a theme toggle feature that switches the app between dark and light modes using the `useContext` hook.

9.  **Custom Hook:**

    - Write a custom hook that fetches data from an API and manages loading, error, and data states. Use this hook in a component to display the fetched data.

10. **Error Boundaries:**


    *   Implement an error boundary component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

### Advanced React Problems

11. **Higher-Order Components (HOC):**


    *   Create an HOC that adds additional data or functionality to a wrapped component (e.g., logging component usage analytics).

12. **Render Props:**


    *   Implement a component that uses the render props pattern to share code between components in a flexible way.

13. **Optimizing Performance:**


    *   Demonstrate the use of `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to optimize a component that has performance issues due to unnecessary re-renders.

14. **React Router:**


    *   Set up a simple SPA (Single Page Application) with React Router, including routes for a home page, about page, and a dynamic route for user profiles.

15. **State Management (Beyond useState/useReducer):**


    *   Illustrate a simple example of global state management using the Context API or any state management library like Redux or Recoil, showing how to share state across multiple components.

### Bonus Problems

16. **Accessibility (a11y):**


    *   Enhance a React application by implementing various accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation, ARIA roles, and semantic HTML.

17. **Internationalization:**


    *   Add internationalization support to a React app, allowing it to display content in multiple languages.

18. **Testing in React:**


    *   Write unit tests for a React component using Jest and React Testing Library, covering user interactions and component logic.

19. **Static Site Generation with Next.js:**


    *   Create a statically generated blog using Next.js, where each post is a markdown file that gets rendered to a webpage at build time.

20. **Server-Side Rendering with Next.js:**


    *   Implement a simple application with server-side rendering to improve load times and SEO for dynamic content.
